Custom ruleset for [spamassassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/).

Please note these rules work for me and are a documentation of how I changed some personalised rules, they may not suit your environment and create false positives - so please ensure you test these rules in your environment before putting them in production.

Rules Inspired by [KAM's Work on KAM.CF](https://mcgrail.com/template/leadership#KAM)
Some inputs and Learnings from [ERCPE](https://github.com/ercpe/ercpe-sa-rules/blob/master/ercpe-rules.cf) and [JULT](https://gist.github.com/jult/9bfdc4d07b44be01a02cc2aaf25b7c39)
